**Design a mature enterprise architecture repository using Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect and ArchiMate® 3.1**

## What is this book about?
Most organizations face challenges in defining and achieving evolved enterprise architecture practices which can be a very lengthy process even if implemented correctly. Developers, for example, can build better solutions only if they receive the necessary design information from architects, and decision-makers can make appropriate changes within the organization only if they know the implications of doing so 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover how enterprise architects can contribute to projects and departments within organizations
* Use Sparx Enterprise Architect to build a rich architecture repository
* Learn about the ArchiMate® 3.1 specification as you apply it in real-world projects
* Use the focused metamodel technique to build the information necessary for maintaining your repository's consistency and accuracy
* Understand the importance of keeping architectural artifacts simple yet eye-catching
* Define an operational model that fits your initial needs and expands as required

**Following is what you need for this book:**
	This book is for enterprise architects at all architectural layers and practices of any maturity level. Many of the artifacts suggested in this book are inspired by The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF®); however, familiarity with TOGAF® is not required. Whether you work within the business, applications, data, or technology layers, this book covers examples that apply to your work. Although not mandatory, experience modeling in Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect using any modeling language will be helpful. No prior knowledge of ArchiMate® is required to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).

## Get to Know the Author
**Mudar Bahri**
is an enterprise architect with long, progressive experience in implementing TOGAF® in large and midsized organizations. He is an independent enterprise architecture mentor and consultant and helps architects to build and develop practical Enterprise Architecture (EA) skills that can provide decision-makers with useful artifacts. He is a certified TOGAF® 9.1 Enterprise Architect with experience in other EA frameworks and project management methodologies. He has used TOGAF® for developing digital transformation strategies, cloud migration plans, solution architectures, and proposals. He believes that enterprise architecture is meant to bridge gaps, not to create new ones, so it has to be simple, practical, and serve everyone.
